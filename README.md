Our progam is very simple. It takes in three inputs from a college student: their name, age, and what university they attend. 
By using a simple control flow structure it then compares the inputted age to the typical age of a student in each college grade year. 
After determining what year the student is most likely in, the program prints a welcoming message to the console, stating that we hope their freshman || sophomore || junior || senior year is going great!
